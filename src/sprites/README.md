Here we store source files for sprites used in the game
which later will be converted to spritesheet by `gen-spritesheet.js` tool.

Commands used:
./script/gen-spritesheet.js -o ./public/sprites/characters/bobr.gif ./src/sprites/bobr-*
./script/gen-spritesheet.js -o ./public/sprites/characters/old-bobr.gif ./src/sprites/old-bobr-*
